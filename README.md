# UniKL Link+

A (mostly) open-source port of the [UniKL Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=my.edu.unikl.uniklconnect) app.

## Why is it mostly open-source and not fully open-source?

Due to the sensitive closed-source nature of where the servers are pointed to, the specific part of the app containing said info is excluded from the app's source code repository.

## Downloads

The app installation files can be found in the [releases page](https://github.com/ProgrammingPleb/unikl-link-plus/releases/).  
For now, only Android releases are available as building apps for iOS has a cost to build. In the future, there will be releases for iOS but will most likely be distributed as IPA files that will need to be sideloaded.

## License
