# UniKL Link+

A (mostly) open-source port of the [UniKL Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=my.edu.unikl.uniklconnect) app.

## Why is it mostly open-source and not fully open-source?

Due to the sensitive closed-source nature of where the servers are pointed to, the specific part of the app containing said info is excluded from the app's source code repository.

## Installation

For ease of installation, the usage of [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) is recommended for automatic updates for versions later than `0.0.8`. The steps for using Obtainium for installing the app are as follows:
1. Download Obtainium from [this link](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/releases/latest). The safest option is to download the file named `app-release.apk`.
2.

3. Tap "Continue" in the "Import App" pop-up in Obtainium.
4. Tap on "UniKL Link+", and tap "Install" to install the app.
5. The app should now be installed. Future updates will be checked by Obtainium, and will prompt for update installation. (unless you have [Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku) for automatic update installation)

Manual installation can be done by downloading the APK files provided in the [Releases](https://github.com/ProgrammingPleb/unikl-link-plus/releases/latest) section.
 
For now, only Android releases are available as building apps for iOS requires me to have an iPhone and a Mac. In the future, there will be releases for iOS but will most likely be distributed as IPA files that will need to be sideloaded.
